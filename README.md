Documentation for /Models/MovieDetails.js

/Models/MovieDetails.js

+> The MovieDetailsSchema is a schema definition for the MovieDetails collection in the MongoDB database.
=> It uses the Mongoose library, which provides a schema-based solution for modeling application data and interacting with MongoDB.
=> The schema defines the structure and validation rules for the MovieDetails collection.
=> The schema has the following fields:
=> Movie_name: A required field of type String representing the name of the movie.
=> Movie_Dir: A required field of type String representing the director of the movie.
=> Movie_year: A required field of type Number representing the year of the movie's release.
=> Movie_rating: A required field of type Number representing the rating of the movie.
=> Movie_watch: A required field of type Boolean indicating whether the movie has been watched or not.
=> Each field in the schema has its own validation rules defined by the required property.
=> The mongoose.model function is used to create a model named 'db' based on the MovieDetailsSchema. This model represents the MovieDetails collection and provides an interface to interact with the collection.
=> The model can be used to perform database operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting movie details.
=> The model is exported so that it can be imported and used in other parts of the application.
=> When using this model, you can create new movie details documents that adhere to the defined schema structure and validation rules.
=> The model also provides methods for querying and manipulating movie details documents in the MongoDB database.
=> This code should be used in conjunction with a MongoDB connection to establish a connection to the database before using the model.
=> You can perform CRUD operations on the MovieDetails collection using the model and interact with the movie details data in your application.
=> The schema can be customized further by adding additional fields or modifying the existing fields according to the requirements of the application.
=> The schema can also include additional validation rules, such as specifying minimum and maximum values for numeric fields or defining custom validation functions.
=> By using this schema, you can ensure consistent and structured data storage for movie details in your MongoDB database.

Documentation for /Router/MovieDetails.js

/Router/MovieDetails.js

=> The MovieDetails Router handles the API endpoints related to movie details.
=> It uses the Express Router to define and handle the routes for movie details operations.
=> The router is responsible for retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting movie details.
=> It interacts with the MovieDetails model (db) defined in the ../models/MovieDetails module.
=> The router is exported so that it can be mounted in the main application file.
=> GET '/' route: Retrieves a list of movie details with pagination support.
     - The page and limit parameters can be provided in the query string to control the pagination.
     - It calculates the total number of movies, skips the appropriate number of documents, and limits the number of documents returned.
     - Returns a JSON response with the retrieved movie details, total movie count, current page number, and total number of pages.
=> GET '/:id' route: Retrieves a specific movie detail by its ID
     - The ID is provided as a route parameter.
    - Returns a JSON response with the retrieved movie detail. 
=> POST '/' route: Creates a new movie detail.
     - The movie details are provided in the request body.
     - Creates a new instance of the MovieDetails model with the provided data.
     - Saves the new movie detail to the database.
     - Returns a JSON response with the saved movie detail.
=> PUT '/:id' route: Updates a specific movie detail by its ID.
     - The ID is provided as a route parameter.
     - The fieldToUpdate and value are provided in the request body.
     - Finds the movie detail by ID and updates the specified field with the new value.
     - Returns a JSON response with the updated movie detail.
=> DELETE '/:id' route: Deletes a specific movie detail by its ID.
     - The ID is provided as a route parameter.
     - Finds the movie detail by ID and removes it from the database.
     - Returns a JSON response with the deleted movie detail.
=> Each route is wrapped in a try-catch block to handle any potential errors and send appropriate error responses.
=> If an error occurs during the execution of a route, it sends an error message along with the error details.
=> The router provides a structured and organized way to handle movie details operations as part of the CRUD functionality.
=> It follows the RESTful API principles and uses appropriate HTTP methods for different operations.
=> The code can be extended or customized further to add more routes or additional functionality based on the specific requirements of the application.

=> Error Handling: 
   - The router includes error handling logic using try-catch blocks to catch and handle any errors that may occur during the execution of route handlers. 
   - If an error occurs, an appropriate error message is sent as the response to the client, along with the error details. 
   - This ensures that error cases are handled gracefully and provide meaningful feedback to the API consumers.

=> Database Interaction: 
   - The router interacts with the MovieDetails model (db) using Mongoose to perform database operations. 
   - It utilizes Mongoose methods such as find, findById, findOneAndUpdate, and findByIdAndRemove to retrieve, update, and delete movie details from the MongoDB database. 
   - The router also includes a POST route to create new movie details by saving a new instance of the MovieDetails model to the database.

=>RESTful Design:
    - The router follows the principles of RESTful API design by mapping HTTP methods to CRUD operations.
    - It uses GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE HTTP methods for retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting movie details, respectively.
    - The route URLs are structured in a logical and meaningful way, using appropriate route parameters and 
query parameters for specific operations like retrieving a single movie detail or implementing pagination.

=> Code Modularity: 
    - The router code is structured in a modular manner by separating it into its own file.
    - This promotes code reusability and maintainability. 
    - The router module can be easily integrated into the main Express application by importing and mounting it at a specific route.
    - This modular approach allows for better organization and scalability, making it easier to manage and expand the API's functionality in the future.
   
Overall, the MovieDetails router provides a clean and structured way to handle movie-related CRUD operations, 
interact with the database, and follow RESTful API design principles.
It can serve as a foundation for building a robust movie details API and can be extended or customized based on specific project requirements.


Documentation for app.js

app.js

Express and Mongoose: The code begins by importing the necessary dependencies, including Express and Mongoose. Express is a popular Node.js framework used for building web applications, while Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library that provides a convenient way to interact with MongoDB.

Express Router: The code creates an instance of the Express Router by invoking express.Router(). The router allows us to define routes and their corresponding handlers separately and later integrate them into the main Express application.

MongoDB Connection: The code establishes a connection to the local MongoDB server using Mongoose's connect method. It specifies the MongoDB server URL (mongodb://localhost:27017/MovieDetails) and handles the success or failure of the connection using promise-based syntax.

JSON Parsing Middleware: The code uses express.json() middleware to parse incoming requests with JSON payloads. This middleware automatically parses the request body and makes it available as req.body in the route handlers, allowing easy access to the JSON data.

MovieDetails Router: The code imports the MovieDetails router module from ./router/MovieDetails and assigns it to the transmitter constant. This router module contains the route handlers and logic for handling movie details-related operations.

Mounting the Router: The code uses app.use() to mount the transmitter router at the /MovieDetails path. This means that any routes defined within the transmitter router will be accessible under the /MovieDetails URL path.

Starting the Server: The code uses app.listen() to start the Express server. It specifies the port number (3000) on which the server will listen for incoming requests. Once the server starts, it logs a message to the console, indicating that the server is running and listening on the specified port.

Separation of Concerns: The code follows the principle of separation of concerns by separating the route handling logic into a separate module (MovieDetails router). This promotes modularity, code organization, and maintainability, making it easier to manage and expand the application.

MongoDB Connection Success/Failure Logging: The code includes appropriate console log statements to indicate whether the MongoDB connection was successful or failed. This helps in troubleshooting and provides feedback on the status of the database connection during development and testing.

RESTful API Design: The code follows RESTful API design principles by using the appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) and URL paths (/MovieDetails) to define the movie details-related routes. This promotes a standardized and predictable API structure.

Scalability: The code lays the foundation for building a scalable web application using Express and MongoDB. By separating the route handling logic into modules and utilizing the Express Router, it becomes easier to add more routes and features as the application grows.

Code Reusability: The code promotes code reusability by encapsulating the movie details-related route handling logic within the MovieDetails router module. This allows the router module to be easily reused in other parts of the application or in future projects.

Configuration Flexibility: The code allows for flexibility in configuring the MongoDB connection URL (mongodb://localhost:27017/MovieDetails) and the server port (3000). These values can be modified to match the specific requirements of the application or development environment.
